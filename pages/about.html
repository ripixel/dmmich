                        <p>Dean is a Level 3 qualified Personal Trainer with a genuine passion for helping people move
                            better, feel stronger, and live healthier lives. Based in Bingham, Nottinghamshire, Dean has
                            built his coaching practice around one simple belief:</p>
                        <blockquote class="pullquote">"Not chasing aesthetics, but health."</blockquote>
                        <p>That means no crash diets, no unsustainable routines, and no pressure to look a certain way.
                            Dean's approach is rooted in <strong>functional fitness</strong> — training that helps you
                            in real life, whether that's carrying the shopping, playing with your kids, or running your
                            first 5K.</p>

                <h2>What is Functional Fitness?</h2>
                <p>Functional fitness focuses on exercises that train your muscles to work together, simulating
                    movements you do in everyday life. Think squats, carries, presses, and pulls — patterns your body
                    was designed for.</p>
                <p>Rather than isolating individual muscles for the sake of aesthetics, functional training builds
                    real-world strength, improves mobility, and reduces the risk of injury. It's training with a
                    purpose.</p>

                <h2>Dean's Philosophy</h2>
                <p>Dean believes that fitness should be accessible, enjoyable, and sustainable. Every client is
                    different, and every programme reflects that. Whether you're brand new to exercise or an experienced
                    athlete, Dean meets you where you are and helps you progress at your own pace.</p>

                    track progress, and stay accountable between sessions. It's like having a coach in your pocket.</p>

                <div class="feature-highlight">
                    <h3>🤘 Train. Progress. Succeed.</h3>
                    <p>That's not just a tagline — it's the framework for every programme Dean writes. Start where you
                        are, build consistently, and celebrate every milestone along the way.</p>
