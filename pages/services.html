                <h2>What to Expect</h2>
                <p>Your first session starts with a chat about your goals, your background, and what you want to get out
                    of training. Dean will assess your movement patterns and build a programme from there — no
                    cookie-cutter plans, no one-size-fits-all.</p>

                <h2>Hevy Pro — Your Training Companion</h2>
                <div class="feature-highlight">
                    <h3>📱 Included with Every Package</h3>
                    <p>All clients receive Hevy Pro — a powerful workout tracking app that lets you log every session,
                        track your progress over time, and follow your personalised programme. Think of it as your coach
                        in your pocket between sessions.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-top: var(--space-md); margin-bottom: var(--space-xs);">Do I need to
                    be fit to start?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely not. Dean works with people of all fitness levels, from complete beginners to experienced
                    athletes. Every programme is built around where you are right now.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-top: var(--space-md); margin-bottom: var(--space-xs);">How often
                    should I train?</h3>
                <p>That depends on your goals and lifestyle. Most clients train 2-3 times per week, but Dean will work
                    with you to find a sustainable schedule that fits your life.</p>

                <h3 style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-top: var(--space-md); margin-bottom: var(--space-xs);">Can I bring
                    a friend?</h3>
                <p>Yes! Small group sessions (2-3 people) are available at a reduced per-person rate. Training with a
                    mate can be a great motivator.</p>
