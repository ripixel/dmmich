Whether you're a seasoned runner or just starting out, you'll fit right in. We're a group of friends who just happen to run together — no memberships, no bib numbers, just good vibes.",
        "body_2": "Our route is lap-based, so you can do as many or as few laps as you like — there's absolutely no minimum distance. After the run, we head to Gilt for coffee and a full English breakfast. Honestly, it's the real reason most of us turn up.",

        "body_2": "No sign-up needed — just turn up, say hello, and join in. After the run, we walk back together and head to Gilt café for coffee, breakfast, and a good natter. It's super relaxed."
